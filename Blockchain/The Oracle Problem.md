The blockchain oracle problem refers to the inability of blockchains to access external data, making them isolated networks, akin to a computer with no Internet connection. Bridging the connection between the blockchain (onchain) and the outside world (offchain) requires an additional piece of infrastructure—an oracle.

The isolation of a blockchain is the precise property that makes it extremely secure and reliable, as the network only needs to form consensus on a very basic set of binary (true/false) questions using data already stored inside of its ledger. These questions include: did the public key holder sign the transaction with their corresponding private key, does the public address have enough funds to cover its transaction, and is the type of transaction valid within the particular smart contract? The very narrow focus of blockchain consensus is why smart contracts are referred to as being deterministic—they execute exactly as written with a much higher degree of certainty than traditional systems.

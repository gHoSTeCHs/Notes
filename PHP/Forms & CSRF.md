**Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a type of attack that exploits the trust that a website has for it's users. It's a type of request forgery that tricks users into sending request to a website, from an untrusted domain. It does this taking advantage of the values in the session storage. If a user is logged into a website that uses sessions for authentication, this can be overridden by attackers, and be used to send requests from unauthorized sites by authenticating themselves with the values from the session.
`Laravel` combats this in blade with the `@csfr` blade directive. This is also known as a hidden token. It's added at the beginning of a form, and Laravel checks the value of this against the one stored in your session, and makes decision based on whether it's corresponds or not.

Going from what we know about [[Swing Structure#^70a71a |swing structure]], we know that from the low formed after the sweep to the high where the reversal started, is where we place our [[Using the Fibonacci tool#^ff4a15 |fib tool]] to mark out our [[Using the Fibonacci tool#^5b70d7|discount, and premium]] for the whole move. And our area of interest should be based on [[Using the Fibonacci tool#^5b70d7|these levels]].

The Fibonacci tool is used to mark out levels in the market to trade off from. In this case, the only level that you require are the 1, 0, and 0.5. This is where premium, equilibrium, and discount comes in.
The Fib tool is used in two ways in this system.
- To mark out premium levels where you look out for sells (in a bullish market), and discount levels, where you look out for the main buys. This is achieved by drawing the Fibonacci tool from the low of the swing, to it's high. In a bullish market, the level above the .50 fib level becomes the premium, and the level below the .50 level is the discount. The .50 level itself becomes the equilibrium. ^ff4a15
- To get a more accurate entry from the discount zone. This acheived by drawing your fib tool from the break of structure, to the low of the [[Swing Structure]]. Your entry should be below the .50 fib level. Above it should be regarded as [[Liquidity]]. ^5b70d7

You main concern should be that price enters the discount level (where it would be cheaper to buy from)

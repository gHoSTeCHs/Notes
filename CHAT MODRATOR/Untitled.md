For the past few weeks, I've been working of something I titled PROJECTO1C, which is basically a deep dive into how @only1chukz trades. You can view the notion journal at https://shorturl.at/EdmmV. It contains a comprehensive library of his past trades, and the probable setup behind them.
I studied he trades, and was able to decipher the base strategy behind them, but I knew something was missing, because I did some forward testing, and was hoping we would have the same trades, but that wasn't the case. I was just plugging the setup everywhere.
@thisdax released a course few days ago, and that was when i knew that i was missing a lot of confluences in the trading system. I've only watched two videos out of 5, and I was able to see some light.
I will be going through @thisdax course within the week, do some back testing and forward testing, and present back the data gotten.



Good day.
